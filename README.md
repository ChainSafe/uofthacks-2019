# uofthacks-2019

This year our good friends at Aragon are offering a prize for the best project that uses their DAO framework.

This framework allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, and assist in smart contract development. A smart contract is a piece of code deployed to a blockchain. It's generally fairly simple, and allows functions to be executed on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). Think of the EVM as a computing system distributed across the world, that can come to consensus and sync to a single source of truth. This is the beauty of distributed ledger(blockchain) technology.

The sort of problems you should be trying to solve are ones where there's a question of trust. Any situation where you are forced into economic or value bearing interactions with strangers, there's probably a more efficient way to do it with a distributed ledger.

## What is Aragon?

"Aragon is a project to empower freedom by creating tools for decentralized organizations to thrive."

Aragon is essentially a DAO in a box. It has everything you need to build, deploy and integrate a DAO. It currently runs on Ethereum (or EVM compatible chains). 

The Aragon framework provides a set of easy to use [common UI elements](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-ui), a [javascript library](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js) for interacting with AragonOS, [a command line tool](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli) for assisting development and [AragonOS](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS) a set of smart contracts that make the magic happen!

The main properties that Aragon offers is:
1. Upgradability - Without Aragon smart contract are not generally upgradable. With Aragon they are! For the purpose of this hackathon this isn't super important.
2. Permissions - While there are ways to provide rudementary authorization in solidity, giving a more robust authorization system allows for us to do all sorts of cool things.
3. Forwarding - Once you have roles and authorizations in place you can assign permissions to contracts, and they as long as those contracts

Aragon can also be used to create any organization that wants to leverage the previously mentioned properties, upgradability, permissions, and forwarding. Not everything made with Aragon is neccesarily a DAO, but it's hard to create DAOs without smart contracts or a distributed ledger.

## What is a DAO?

(D)ecentralized - to distribute administrative powers or functions

(A)utonomous - having the freedom to act independently

(O)rganization - an organized body of people with a particular purpose (eg. a company)

tl;dr A DAO is an self-governing organization with no central entity.
