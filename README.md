# uofthacks-2019

This year our good friends at Aragon are offering a prize for the best project that uses their DAO framework.

## What is a DAO?

(D)ecentralized - to distribute administrative powers or functions

(A)utonomous - having the freedom to act independently

(O)rganization - an organized body of people with a particular purpose (eg. a company)

tl;dr A DAO is an self-governing organization with no central entity.

## What is Aragon?

"Aragon is a project to empower freedom by creating tools for decentralized organizations to thrive."

Aragon is essentially a DAO in a box. It has everything you need to build, deploy and integrate a DAO. It currently runs on Ethereum (or EVM compatible chains).
